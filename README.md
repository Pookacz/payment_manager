Payments manager is a tool which allows to plan your payments to not run over the budget. 
It is very helpful for people who has a problem with money management.
All you have to do is set a specified budget. Then you can start planning your payments.

### There are six payments categories:
- Food 
- Entertainment
- Accessories
- Subscription

- Other

You can't add a payment without the category.

In the left sided navbar you can see how much budget do you have to use and how much does cost you each category. On the right you have forms to set new payments and budget.
